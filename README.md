# Energy Cunsumption App

The app is built on the Flutter Framework and utilizes FL Chart as the foundation for implementing graphical charts. To optimize performance, the app leverages Hive for data caching, reducing unnecessary API calls. Additionally, it supports a dark mode for a better user experience.
